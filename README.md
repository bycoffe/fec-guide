A developer's guide to FEC data
=============

This document is an attempt to describe the range of federal campaign finance data provided by the [Federal Election Commission](http://fec.gov/) and its usage by developers. It assumes no prior knowledge of campaign finance law or practice, but some familiarity with the U.S. federal electoral system, such as the difference between the House and Senate.
